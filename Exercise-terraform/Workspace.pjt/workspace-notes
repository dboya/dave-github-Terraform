Actually a work space is an isolated working environment within a resource which enables someone to do his private work. within terraform, workspaces could be created using the folllwing commands:
- "terraform workspace -h" = will show you all the available options applicable to workspace such as delete, create, show, etc....

syntax and its display is as follows:

$ terraform workspace -h
Usage: terraform [global options] workspace

  new, list, show, select and delete Terraform workspaces.

Subcommands:
    delete    Delete a workspace
    list      List Workspaces
    new       Create a new workspace
    select    Select a workspace
    show      Show the name of the current workspace

The following thus shows how the various subcommands are used (or called):

- CREAT: 
  "terraform workspace new 'workspace name' " Forexample: "terraform workspace new dev". this will create a new workspace called "dev"

- SELECT:
  "terraform workspace select 'workspace name' " . this will chose a particular workspace within which you can carryout your work. this command is only useful if you have multile workspaces to work in. Forexample: "terraform workspace select production" will now open but the production workspace for you to start working in.


- LIST:
  "terraform workspace list" . this command will lists all the workspaces you have (or have created) and the current workspace within which you are working in will be marked by an asterix:


- SHOW:
  "terraform workspace show ". this command will show the current or active workspace within which you are working in:
